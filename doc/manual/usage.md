First, require the polyfill at the entry point of your application
```js
await import('regenerator-runtime/runtime.js');
// or
import 'regenerator-runtime/runtime.js';
```

Then, import the library where needed
```js
const specification = await import('@comparison-searching/specification');
// or
import * as specification from '@comparison-searching/specification';
```
